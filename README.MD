# Arbitrary Geometry Offside

This is a supplement to the repository [Arbitrary Geometry](https://github.com/willsuan/arbitrary-geometries). It consists of some demo work and personal explorations of the code in that repository.

This will be updated as I explore the codebase and learn more about how to use it. It will be relatively unstructured, mainly a collection of small learning notes/demo walkthroughs and experiments.
